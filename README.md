## Strategy
----------------
__Project goals__

The aim of this project is present the company products in a simple and clear but professional way. It was important to create a user-friendly and approachable site with a modern design and feel. The products have to be presented in a clear and familar way. This makes the site more accessible to users who are new to the site and need to find information quickly.

The features and content of the site therefore had to include;
- Product Titles, Descriptions and Prices.
- Familar genres and types.
- An approachable user interface and registration/login functionality.


__User goals__ 

The user goals will be met by enabling the user get access to the products, purchasing and blogs in a clear and concise format. The users require the ability to quickly search for their topic and filter out the irrelevant information. The users goals will be achieved through a landing page featuring nav links, a search element and registration/login option. There will also be links to the club section which is for registered users only.

## Skeleton 
----------------
### **Wireframes** ###

The Skeleton of the project design was built utilising [Wireframes](https://www.Wireframes.com/). 

The overall basic design breakpoints can be seen below:

![Wireframes](/media/.png)


### **Changes to initial wireframes** ###
A number of design edits were made throughout the project with the purpose of increased userability and clarity. These include:
- The navbar will be consistent throughout the pages.
- The landing page will feature an image carosuel that has relevant product links.
 

## Surface 
----------------
The site aimed to be dark with bright elements. The colour choice was to be dark so that nothing distracts from the key data and information. The light will be contrasted with bright yellow nav elements, white footer elements and a white background product page.

**Colour Theme**

![Image](media/color.png)

**Typography**

- The font used for both body and headings is [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora). This font was chosen for its professionalism and clarity.
I wanted to bring a modern design feel to the site and utilising a font that is widely used was effective.
The site also has 'Sans Serif' as an alternative font.
- The main logo or title is [Playfair](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair)

# **Technologies**
## Database
---------------
Two relational databases were used to create this site - during production SQLite was used and then Postgres was used for the deployed Heroku version.

The database model is extended from Django-Allauth, which enables user authentication, email and password verification functionality.

The database functionality: 
- Registered users and emails feed into the User profile.
- Models for genres, condition, category are linked to the products.
- Once an order is created the user profile and product data is linked in the orderline item.
- The blog is a standalone model, only utilised as an add-on for registered users.

The content is broken down in clear descriptions with text inputs from the forms. The images are uploaded directly. The naming convention was kept concise and relevant to the site.

The schema is seen below:

## Languages
---------------
For this project two languages were used:
- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/#:~:text=HTML%20is%20the%20standard%20markup,learn%20%2D%20You%20will%20enjoy%20it!)
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)
- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Libraries, Frameworks and Technologies
---------------

- [Bootstrap](https://bootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap was used to for its easy to use grid and repsonsive layout. Elelments of the navbar, cards and forms were taken from the site.

- [Coolors](https://coolors.co) - Used to create colour palette and test colour themes.

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Google font 'Lato' was included in the project.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - All icons used throughout the project come from fontawesome.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Used for aspects of userability.

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - The main build of the site is around Django.

- [Mock-Up Generator](https://techsini.com/multi-mockup/index.php) - Used for title photo.

- [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) - Used for site deployment.

- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) - Used for file storage.

## Workspace and Version Control
--------------------
- [Github](https://github.com/) - The project is hosted on Github and the live website is worked through Github pages.

- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) - The project used Gitpod IDE for build and development. 

# **Testing**
## Code Validators 
---------------
A number of code validation techniques were utilised to ensure proper testing of site. 
For HTML and CSS, I used the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org) and [W3C CSS Validation Services](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). 
See below for results.

- HTML: All sites pass validation.
- CSS: No errors. 


## Javascript
--------------
A combination of [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) and manual testing was completed on the javascript to ensure adequate quality. 
- No errors found in manual test. Basic javascript from Code Institute Project Ado project.

## Python
--------------
Python was manually tested and functioned well. Some indentation issues and line length issues arose.

Please note the line-length and indentation issues have been fixed where possible, however, for clarity and ease of use some line lengths have been left to be greater than the standard 79 character limit. Please not that this is done for readability and productivity. Where possible they have been edited to be PEP8 compliant, but other instances have been left for contextual reasons. For example, a comment explaining why the element is required. 

## Responsive Elements 
--------------

The responsivity of the page was tested primarily using [Google Chrome Dev Tools]() and manual resizing of windows. The test provided positive results for each 
device option. The responsive breakpoints and resizing worked throughout the site. The site was shared with colleagues and friends and tested 
on their devices. The site worked well on all devices tested and there was no problem with browser compatibility found during these tests.

  
## Search Accuracy and Functionality
--------------
Manual testing was completed and the following results were found:

- The search function worked well.
- The add, edit and delete functions completed their required tasks and were easy to use.
- The login and register functions were tested and performed well.
